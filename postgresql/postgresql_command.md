# PostgreSQL

**Definition:** PostgreSQL is an open-source relational database management system (RDBMS).

It is used to:

🔷 Store data  
🔷 Manage data  
🔷 Query data  
🔷 Maintain relationships between data

It follows the SQL (Structured Query Language) standard.

## Why is it used?
PostgreSQL is used to store, manage, and retrieve structured data efficiently and securely.

It is mainly used in applications where:

🔷 Data needs to be stored reliably  
🔷 Multiple users access data simultaneously  
🔷 Complex queries are required  
🔷 Transactions must be safe and consistent  

## How to install PostgreSQL in ubuntu?

1️⃣ Update packages  
``` bash
sudo apt update
```  
2️⃣ Install PostgreSQL  
``` bash
sudo apt install postgresql postgresql-contrib
```  
3️⃣ Check if service is running  
``` bash
sudo systemctl status postgresql
```  
PostgreSQL will be installed after this.

## Switch to postgres user

``` bash
sudo -i -u postgres
```
### OR
``` bash
sudo -iu postgres
```

## Open PostgreSQL shell
```bash
psql
```

**EXAMPLE:** 
``` bash
cheshta@cheshta-Latitude-E7470:~$ sudo -iu postgres 
[sudo] password for cheshta: 
postgres@cheshta-Latitude-E7470:~$ psql
psql (12.22 (Ubuntu 12.22-0ubuntu0.20.04.4))
Type "help" for help.

postgres=# 
```

## Basic psql Commands
psql provides special built-in commands called meta-commands.
These commands start with a backslash (\) and are used to manage and navigate the PostgreSQL environment.
They are different from normal SQL commands.

### Commonly Used psql Commands
1️⃣ Help Command:  
🔷 \? → Shows all available psql commands.  
🔷 \h → Shows help for SQL commands.

Used to understand available operations and syntax guidance.
2️⃣ Database Commands:  
🔷 \l → Lists all databases.  
🔷 \c → Connects to a specific database.  

Used for database navigation.
3️⃣ Table and Schema Commands:  
🔷 \dt → Lists tables in the current database.  
🔷 \d → Describes a table.  
🔷 \dn → Lists schemas.  

Used for inspecting database structure.
4️⃣ Session Control Commands:  
🔷 \q → Quits psql.  
🔷 \! → Executes a system (shell) command.  

Used for managing the working session.

## Data Types in PostgreSQL

**Definition:** While creating table, for each column, you specify a data type, i.e., what kind of data you want to store in the table fields. They ensure data integrity, consistency, and proper storage.

### Categories of Data Types  

1️⃣ Numeric Data Types: Used to store numerical values.

Includes:  
🔷 Small integers  
🔷 Standard integers  
🔷 Large integers  
🔷 Exact decimal numbers  
🔷 Floating point numbers  

These are used for storing quantities, prices, counts, measurements, etc.

2️⃣ Character Data Types: Used to store textual data.

Includes:  
🔷 Fixed-length strings  
🔷 Variable-length strings  
🔷 Unlimited-length text  

Used for names, addresses, descriptions, and textual information.

3️⃣ Date and Time Data Types: Used to store date and time values. 

Includes:  
🔷 Date  
🔷 Time  
🔷 Timestamp  
🔷 Time intervals

Used for tracking events, logs, transactions, and records.

4️⃣ Boolean Data Type: Used to store logical values.

Possible values:  
🔷 True  
🔷 False

Used for status fields such as active/inactive, yes/no, enabled/disabled.

5️⃣ Auto-Increment Type: Used to automatically generate unique numeric values.  
Commonly used for primary keys to uniquely identify records.

## Create databse
PostgreSQL provides two ways of creating a new database −  
🔷 Using CREATE DATABASE, an SQL command.  
🔷 Using createdb a command-line executable.

### Using CREATE DATABASE

This command will create a database from PostgreSQL shell prompt.

#### Syntax
The basic syntax of CREATE DATABASE statement is as follows −  
``` bash
CREATE DATABASE dbname;
```

**Example:** Creating and connecting with a database.  
```bash
postgres=# CREATE DATABASE company_db;
CREATE DATABASE
postgres=# \c company_db
You are now connected to database "company_db" as user "postgres".
company_db=# 
```

## Create table  
 CREATE TABLE statement is used to create a new table in any of the given database.

 #### Syntax
 The basic syntax of creating a table is as follows:  
```bash 
CREATE TABLE table_name(
   column1 datatype,
   column2 datatype,
   column3 datatype,
   .....
   columnN datatype,
   PRIMARY KEY( one or more columns )
);
```
**Example:**
```bash
company_db=# CREATE TABLE departments(
company_db(# department_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
company_db(# department_name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL UNIQUE
company_db(# );
CREATE TABLE
```
